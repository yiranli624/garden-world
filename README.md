# Garden World - Personal project

## Project Overview
This is demo for seeding business. When browsing through the [original site](https://asiangarden2table.com/), as much as I love the product, the website was painfully slow and difficult to use. The idea of mixing my passion excited me to bring this project to live. After all, what's better than choose your own tech stack to build something you love?
